# CI-CD-Test-Repo

In this repository, I will be creating a basic project and implementing a CI/DC pipeline in order to run scans and tests on the project!

This project will include simple unit tests and have them run on each PR merge or branch merge
- If one or more tests fail, the build will fail and it will send a notification

It will also have UI tests and they will run nightly
- Send notification on failure
